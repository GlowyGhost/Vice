Installation may be a bit awkward due to needing a virtual mic. Vice requires you to install a virtual audio device for input and output. This is required for some apps to recognise the virtual mic and so people without access to their BIOS (e.g. people using laptops) can still use Vice. The most common virtual mic is [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable). To install:

1. Download [VB-Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable) and go through the installation process. This requires you to restart.
2. Download Vice.
3. Set Vice's output to **`Cable Input`**. If there's no option then rerun the VB-Cable installer.
4. In any apps or games you want to use this virtual mic, Set it's input to **`Cable Output`**
